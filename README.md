# Exploring a Relational Database

The Sakila Movie database is a relational database of online DVD rentals. I queried the database to answer questions about business problems. In this project, l investigated a relational database while working with PostgreSQL. I completed the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question, running appropriate SQL queries to answer questions, and finishing by sharing findings with insightful visualization.
